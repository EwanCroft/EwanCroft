# About Me

I am a British programmer and hobbyist poet. I was born in Spain, raised in the UK (I am of English-Scottish heritage.) I enjoy many things, but these are my favorites:

- Writing poetry
- [Lycanthropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf) (you can thank [CBBC's "Wolfblood"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfblood) for that)
- Linguistics and language
- Doctor Who
- PlayStation and Nintendo
- Steven Universe
- [BEASTARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastars)
- [The SCP Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation), with my favorites being [SCP-999](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-999), [SCP-001 "When Day Breaks"](https://scpfoundation.fandom.com/wiki/SCP-001_%27%27When_Day_Breaks%27%27), and [SCP-488-JP](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-488-jp).
- [Analog Horror](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Analog_Horror), specifically [Kane Pixel's "Backrooms"](https://kane-pixels-backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/Kane_Pixels_Backrooms_Wiki) and [Liminal Land](https://www.visitliminalland.net/)

I mainly use GitHub to fool around, it's not really a professional thing for me.
